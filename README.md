### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘€

I'm David Joseph.

I am learning Web Development through [The 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). I am a budding full stack web developer and have learnt to use HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript and jQuery 3 to make nice and responsive websites. I am currently learning Node.js and Express.js to start my journey in backend web development.

I play guitar, piano and sing too. I listen to a lot of emo/rock/punk music. Check out something I've recommended [here](https://deej4y.github.io/WeeklySongRecommendation/).
